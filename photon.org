* Assumptions made
- Particles are spherical, with a density of n/metre^3 (p) and volume V
At each point there is a probability pV of scattering
Could be some problems with correlations when integrating - eg. integrating with too small time steps
since I don't consider correlations in position of particles

the theta probability distribution is 2(1+cos^2(theta))/(3*pi)
