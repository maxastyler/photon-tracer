* Assumptions made
- Particles are spherical, with a density of n/metre^3 (p) and volume V
  At each point there is a probability pV of scattering
  Could be some problems with correlations when integrating - eg. integrating with too small time steps
  since I don't consider correlations in position of particles

- the theta probability distribution is $2(1+\cos^2(\theta))/(3\pi)$

- For the probability of intersection of a particle and the photon path:
  need to take a volume V where the density is assumed constant
  then take a smaller volume v = πr^2Δ where Δ is the length of the path the light makes in time dt 
  which is assumed to be much smaller than the larger volume V
  v << V
  The probability of finding 0 particles in a volume v is given by: $(1-v/V)^{pV}$
  When using the series expansion of this, in the limit of v being very small we have $p(0) \approx 1 - pv$
  So the probability of encountering a particle along the path taken by light, Δ is given by:
  $p(\mathrm{scatter}) \approx pv$
  
* Optimisations to make:
- Have a look at the rng function. Maybe I could include the thread_rng varible in
  the world model, so it's iterated over. Might be faster
- Maybe have the particle_cross_section*dx calculated only once, then fed to the world simulation
  rather than calculating every timestep, since it's a constant
